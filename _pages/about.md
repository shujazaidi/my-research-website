I completed my PhD in Computational Soft Matter Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, India. My research generally encompasses understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in soft matter systems. Using computer simulations and statistical mechanics, I investigate emergent kinetics in systems driven far from equilibrium, including phase-separating binary mixtures, driven polymer barrier crossing in multistable landscapes, and active colloidal suspensions exhibiting nonequilibrium steady states.    


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture #`prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit #`_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. #Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
